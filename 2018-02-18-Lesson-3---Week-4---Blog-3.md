    <td>We were given a manual to learn from, I found that if i looked at the pictures it gave me an ideal goal for how my coding should look - and end up working , and looking as such and such. Like every week we use this manual - but this week we were mainly using the change of variables and additions - how a variable can be used in comparison to another - i learnt using this information, understanding it involved mainly logic. Effective strategies are as simply using logic to achieve the task.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When we were working, we'd mess up a lot, because we weren’t using full logic - at one particular point we had to re-look and redo a certain error 9 times over, and that was from just messing up at this one point - and not checking around at this - we looked at different areas and never thought to look there, next time i should work on using logic all the way through and looking at multiple areas.

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time ill change my perspective on work - focus more so on using logic and work my way through checking everything works and making sure i understand completely why things didn’t work - that’s how I learn. I will improve my learning furthermore like this, and hopefully progress even further next time.</td>
