  <tr>
    <td>We were given a manual to learn from, I found that if i looked at the pictures it gave me an ideal goal for how my coding should look - and end up working , and looking as such and such. As you'd expect from coding, a lot of logic was inputted into the coding - the machine would understand counting methods with a built in calculator, and abuse the use of variables when used correctly.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning was the fact that the fact that we kept rushing, when we rushed we’d make mistakes in the typing - and when we did that, it was on the main output, so we’d have to restart - this was very time consuming and furthered into work achieved lessening. I need to work on taking it slow and not just going as fast as i can to finish the work, sometimes taking your time is better.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I’ll focus on the work at hand, the fact that i rush shows a lack of focus due to the fact that those who rush and mess up. To improve my learning I will try to understand the coding better rather than just follow the guide - I realise now that i only saw that it was made of logic - next time i will focus more on what it directly means and why it would or wouldnt work.</td>
