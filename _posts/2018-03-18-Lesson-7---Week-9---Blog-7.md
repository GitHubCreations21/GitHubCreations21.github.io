  <tr>
    <td>We were given a manual to learn from, i initially started by reading the functions and theory behind how the fuze box works - before learning how to use it. This time we were more following the images, to plug in these wires - to make it so the lights would turn on and off - on the breadboard, we did this by copying pictures from the manual - less than reading it. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The pictures were unclear - hard to see, because they were relatively slow, so we had to pick up with the initiative of how it worked, but I didn't really understand how it worked. Which of course is a problem i shouldn’t be facing, because the whole point is to learn how to fix these mistakes of mine. I need to work on just being quicker in general - if i was quicker i could of figured out what was right and wrong in a faster manner, therefore learning more.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i’ll focus on quickening, and being able to figure  things out - purely from understanding, upping my deducing skills, and logic capability. This will improve my general understanding of coding, plus efficiency in general when it comes to work, so this is the best possible habit to work on - quickening logical assumptions and pace of work when it comes to using my bare hands - rather than just typing in coding. When typing in the code - this time I’ll be more aware of what it effects, breadboard and onscreen. AS well as learn the functions of each of the wires. ← main target.</td>
