    <td>All of us were given the website codecademy, to learn python from. Lessons are given through the website - instructing us to observe how it works - and then giving us tasks to complete using what we just learnt. The most effective strategies were mostly just using logic and relating the information to something relatable that i understand - so i can understand it better.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This time my learning wasn't limited as such - but  my progress could of been hoped to be further. I need to work on my efficiency - but not to make mistakes on the way, it’s only natural to mess up on your first few tries but,I need to make more of an effort to pick up the pace and not mess-up as frequently.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i'll focus on quickening, and being able to figure  things out - purely from understanding, upping my deducing skills, and logic capability. This will improve my general understanding of coding, plus efficiency in general when it comes to work, so this is the best possible habit to work on - quickening logical assumptions and pace of work when it comes to using my bare hands - rather than just typing in coding. When typing in the code - this time ill try to relate more to the coding.</td>
