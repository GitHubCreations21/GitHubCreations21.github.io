    <td>All of us were given the website codecademy, to learn python from. Lessons are given through the website - instructing us to observe how it works - and then giving us tasks to complete using what we just learnt. The most effective strategies were mostly just using logic and relating the information to something relatable that i understand - so i can understand it better. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was too reliant on the option to be given the answer - I'm very far behind due to redoing work on another account by accident. But I should start speeding up - due to the rust from the half term break slowly going away - meaning I can fully understand the code - much better than previously. I need to work on checking my account, as well as making sure to put an effort - rather than just being given the solution.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i'll focus on quickening, and being able to figure  things out - purely from understanding, upping my deducing skills, and logic capability. I shall also work on trying harder to understand it. Due to overusing the 'give solution’ button. I find it quite sad that I can’t figure out work that people have already finished. So I shall put more effort.</td>
