    <td>All of us were given the website codecademy, to learn python from. Lessons are given through the website - instructing us to observe how it works - and then giving us tasks to complete using what we just learnt. The most effective strategies were mostly just using logic and relating the information to something relatable that i understand - so i can understand it better. Mr Keen before leaving the classroom also gave us a talk - so another strategy was listening.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited me was the fact that I'm far behind still - and i have a hard time concentrating for a full hour. I need to work on the habits of keeping focus and also keeping the logical state of mind - trying to solve and learn as much as possible through codecademy. Mr Keen also as stated previously did a talk before leaving - where he explained if we’d rather be a computer or a memory disk. We should try our hardest to solve a problem without help from others, because as humans we have the great ability of being able to solve things.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i'll focus on quickening, and being able to figure  things out - purely from understanding, upping my deducing skills, and logic capability. I shall also work on trying harder to understand it. Due to overusing the 'give solution’ button. I find it quite sad that I can’t figure out work that people have already finished. So I shall put more effort. This goal should stay common - but ill also focus on solving my own problems more efficiently - due to at the first 10 mintues, i tried to fix my computer that wasnt turning on, when instead i should of notified Mr Keen that it wasnt working and what i had tried, then carried on my lesson on another computer - sooner.</td>
