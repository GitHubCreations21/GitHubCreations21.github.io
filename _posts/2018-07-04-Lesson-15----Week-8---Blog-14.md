  <tr>
    <td>All of us were given the website codecademy, to learn python from. Lessons are given through the website - instructing us to observe how it works - and then giving us tasks to complete using what we just learnt. The most effective strategies were mostly just using logic and relating the information to something relatable that i understand - so i can understand it better.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact im going quite quickly through the work - is also lessening my understanding - it's hard to remember and use logically. Which is bad - this is because I need to remember it to use in the future - otherwise what am I learning it for. I need to work on further still - looking through the code and making sure i understand everything with the logic behind it - and what it does.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I’ll focus on keeping up a good pace - to catch up stage wise. But whilst also understanding everything that is put forward. This will improve my learning because it is learning rather than just going through the work to catch up - If i look back at the lesson - in a week i won’t be able to remember anything unless reminded and used. This means I need to work hard at understanding and remember functions.</td>
