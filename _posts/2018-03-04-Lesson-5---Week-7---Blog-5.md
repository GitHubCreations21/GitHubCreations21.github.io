    <td>We were given a manual to learn from, i initially started by reading the functions and theory behind how the fuze box works - before learning how to use it. Once again it was all dependant on understanding - there wasn't much to understand this time, apart from the fact of placement as well as the usage of answer</td>

    <td>We had to restart 4 times, on one lengthy part of coding, in the end we managed it, but wasted 15 minutes, just re-typing this code - due to not saving. I need to work on remembering how to save, in a new file, for a brand new piece of coding, not saving void.</td>

    <td>Next time i’ll focus on remembering on how to save properly to my USB drive. This’ll make my time used much more effectively - instead of repeating something I have learnt already. I will improve my learning by making sure im efficient - but can understand what is told to me through the manual.</td>
