    <td>We were given a manual to learn from, I found that if i looked at the pictures it gave me an ideal goal for how my coding should look - and end up working , and looking as such and such. Like every week we use this manual - but this week - when using the manual - we used a strategy that was far more effective, how it worked was that we - instead of deleting all the code - we edited from the previous piece of code - halving the work of some. Meaning we progressed further.</td>

    <td>This lesson a sub item that limited me - was my blog, i spent the beginning of the lesson - watching others get told off for their blogs not being up to standard - and mine wasn't any better - so in the end i was scolded for 5 minutes due to not meeting the standards - that i should of been able to accomplish. I need to work on my homework organisation - and focusing on the sub item for IT - the blogs.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time ill make sure i have the blog ready - as well as next time get fully engaged to the lesson - as i should normally. I will improve my learning next time by doing the same as my target last week - i feel my target wasnt as met as it should have been - so i shall look at the coding and try understand it more closely - we were working on counting with the variables and singularities - mainly counting with 1, 0s and creating patterns - but there were multiple things i didnt understand.</td>
